# Exp - 4 HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:
To study the problem statement ,SRS document and draw the UML diagram of Hospital management system.
# SRS (Procedure):
1.A Hospital Management System is a computerized system designed to manage all hospital operations efficiently. It helps doctors, nurses, and administrative staff handle patient information, appointments, billing, and medical records in an organized manner.

2.The system stores details of patients, doctors, and staff in a secure database. When a patient visits the hospital, their information can be quickly accessed, and new data such as diagnosis, treatment, and prescriptions can be easily updated.

3.Patients can book appointments with doctors, check schedules, and receive reports through the system. It also helps hospitals manage room availability, track patient admissions, and record discharge details.

4.The billing module automatically calculates charges for consultations, treatments, tests, and medications, ensuring accurate and transparent payment processing. It reduces manual errors and saves time for both staff and patients.

5.Overall, the Hospital Management System improves efficiency, enhances patient care, and ensures smooth coordination among hospital departments. It supports a modern, digital, and paperless healthcare environment.
